"""An upload service that hands work off rather than waiting for it.

Two hand-offs, two shapes of link. handle_upload() stores the file
and fans thumbnail generation out to a thread pool with detach(),
returning before the thumbnails exist: the thumbnail work records as
its own tree, linked back to the request that started it, and the
request's duration is its own. It also enqueues a notification: the
producer captures the in-flight event with handoff() and puts its
headers on the message, and the consumer thread's block(links=...)
names those headers, so the notification tree links back to the
request across what would, with a real broker, be a process
boundary.

Nothing here imports wrapture apart from those two calls; every
event comes from the [[observe]] entries in uploads.toml.
