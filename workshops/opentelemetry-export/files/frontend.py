"""The client half: orders quotes over HTTP.

Nothing here mentions trace headers. The client.toml next to it
observes these functions, and its [[instrument]] entry instruments
urllib so every outbound request carries the current trace identity;
the minted id then reappears in the server's records.

The one piece of embedded instrumentation is the pair of blocks in
fetch_quote, splitting the exchange into making the request (which
returns once the response status and headers arrive) and consuming
the reply body, so the two phases show separately in a trace. Blocks
are inert when nothing is recording, so the module still runs
unobserved.
